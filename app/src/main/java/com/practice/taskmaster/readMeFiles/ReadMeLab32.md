# Lab 32

## Description

In today's lab, we made significant updates by replacing the existing room codes with Amazon Web Services (AWS)
DynamoDB integration. This enhancement allows us to leverage DynamoDB, a robust and scalable NoSQL database
service provided by AWS, as our primary data storage solution instead of the previously used room-based storage
system. This transition marks a pivotal shift in our data management strategy, empowering us to take full
advantage of the benefits and capabilities offered by AWS services for improved data storage and retrieval
in our application.
