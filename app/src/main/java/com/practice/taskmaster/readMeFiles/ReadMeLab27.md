# Lab 27

## Description

In todays lab we continued working on our task master app where we added a setting page that allow the users to enter the their username and it will be displayed in the home page. In addition to adding three hard coded tasks when you click on any of them it will direct you to that task details page in which the title will be the same as the button label.
